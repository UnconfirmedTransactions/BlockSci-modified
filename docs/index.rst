BlockSci Version 0.7 Documentation
====================================

**As of November 2020, we are no longer actively developing or supporting BlockSci.** Please be aware that as cryptocurrencies continue to evolve, they may lose compatibility with BlockSci and might break it in unexpected ways.

The Bitcoin blockchain — currently 280 GB and growing — contains a massive amount of data that can give us insights into the Bitcoin ecosystem, including how users, businesses, and miners operate. BlockSci enables fast and expressive analysis of Bitcoin’s and many other blockchains. The accompanying paper explains its design and applications: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-kalodner.pdf.

Please refer to the `release notes`_ to learn about new features, important bug fixes and other changes.
