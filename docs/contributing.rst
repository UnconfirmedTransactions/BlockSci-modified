We welcome contributions to BlockSci. Below we've listed a few ways you can help improve BlockSci:

- *Maintenance:* We greatly appreciate help in maintaining BlockSci, including raising issues with reproducible examples, reviewing pull requests, helping answer questions about using BlockSci, or fixing smaller bugs.
- *Documentation:* We welcome contributions that improve our documentation_ and FAQ_ or add helpful comments to the code.
- *Testing:* We welcome contributions that extend or improve our existing Python and C++ test suites. We also welcome improvements of the `testchain-generator`_ that we use to generate a synthetic blockchain to run tests against.
- *Code contributions:* If you're interested in making larger code contributions (e.g., adding new features, extensive rewrites of existing code), please contact us first.
